# accelerometer-interpreter
Accelerometer Interpreter is the github repo for the Olin College Spring 2015 Signals and Systems final project of Ryan Louie, Meg McCauley, and Jennifer Wei.

The purpose of the accelerometer interpreter is to take data, window it, extract features, and feed those features into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to find the likelihood of the features looking like that of each of the activity models.

Initial data are collected to feed into the model for it to learn.

A blogpost or some sort of written report will be released soon!
