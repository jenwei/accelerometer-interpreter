# accelerometer-interpreter
Accelerometer Interpreter is the github repo for the Olin College Spring 2015 Signals and Systems final project of Ryan Louie, Meg McCauley, and Jennifer Wei.

The purpose of the accelerometer interpreter is to take a signal, and using the dataset we have, compare the two to determine what activity the signal is from.

This description will be edited as we continue working on this project!
